# misterben_pre_react
My website, before I rewrote the whole thing in React.

The new site is way more powerful and flexible, but there's something nice about a site that's just mainly simple html and css.

However, this site was always waiting to be rebuilt, so some design choices even look like they were getting ready to turn into components.
