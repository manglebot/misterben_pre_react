                <div class="blurb">
                  <p>As a dedicated web designer, I have spent years refining my skills in creating visually captivating websites. My expertise lies in design, complemented by a working knowledge of coding, which allows me to bring my designs to life.</p>
                  <p>Throughout my web design career, I have had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects. One notable example is my work with B'Spoke Coffee, where I successfully developed an e-commerce site, overseeing the design and implementation process.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>B'Spoke Coffee Redesign 2022</h2>
                <div class="blurb">
                  <h3>Three Unique Websites, One Designer</h3>
                  <p>B'Spoke Coffee's digital journey underwent three distinct phases, and I was at the helm of all three projects. The first iteration involved a cost-effective approach using an off-the-shelf free WordPress theme, which I tweaked and customized to establish a fully functional website and blogging platform for the new company.</p>

                  <p>Original site:</p>
                  <p class="caption"><img src="../img/bspoke_screenshots.jpg" alt="B'spokes old website"></p>

                  <p>For the second special Christmas site, I drew inspiration from designer <a href="http://www.adiwright.co.uk" target="_blank">Adi Wright</a>'s new logo for B'spoke and rough concept to create a distinctive and engaging site using WooCommerce within WordPress. Although it was my first time building a WooCommerce site, the result was a resounding success.</p>

                  <p>Adi's Supplied concept below, along with a rough drawing from Nick at B'spoke</p>
                  <p><img src="../img/bspoke_concept_2019+drawing.jpg" alt="B'spokes xmas concepts" class="caption"></p>

                  <p>Here is how it turned out (screenshot so not showing header or footer)</p>
                  <p><img src="../img/bspoke_xmas.jpg" alt="B'spoke Christmas website screenshot" class="caption"></p>
                  
                  <p>The third site was a creative combination of the previous Christmas site, innovative design concepts from local artist Pip Claffay - <a href="https://www.rune-creative.co.uk" target="_blank">https://www.rune-creative.co.uk</a>, and my own contribution. The design drew inspiration from Pip's dripping graphic, which I transformed into a dynamic visual element. For a touch of fun and personality, I animated one of Pip's bicycle graphics using the GSAP javascript animation library, which reacts to users scrolling.</p>
                  <p>With WooCommerce as the backbone, I applied custom requests, such as free postage over &pound;25 (excluding subscriptions) and offered lessons on how B'Spoke could update the website themselves. The end result was a clean and functional shop interface that showcases their products effectively.</p>
                  <p>B'Spoke Coffee love their website; you can check it out at <a href="http://bspokecoffeehouse.co.uk">bspokecoffeehouse.co.uk</a>.</p>

                  <p>Pip's concepts.</p>

                  <!-- <p>I took this idea and created a mockup, and while there are some nice graphics it seemed a little busy.</p>

                  <p>Early mockups. All too busy.</p>

                  <p>For the homepage I removed everything except the logo, and added a menu. Below is the tablet view.

                  <p>I put some of Pip's original graphics in the footer of the desktop site (instagram feed shown above).</p>
